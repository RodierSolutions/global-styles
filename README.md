# Global Styles (In Progress)
*Written by:* Jess Rodier
*Version:* 1.0.0
*Last Updated:* December 20, 2018

## Introduction
This repository contains the basics for creating global styles for your websites/apps. See README for more information.

## Quick Notes
*Please note:* the files in this style guide are pre-compiled. You will have to use a sass compiler and prefixer in order to do big things!

I recommend keeping the global-styles folder completely separate from your project styles just for simplicity's sake, but who am I to tell you what to do?!

## Combining with Other Styles / Frameworks
These styles can be used in combination with any other CSS/JS framework such as Bootstrap and Bulma (any others are fine as well). If you want these styles to override a framework's styles, be sure to link the compiled stylesheet _after_ your framework. You'll want to link to other project-specific styles after these global styles due to the fact that you'll probably want those to override these... but do as you wish!
